# Messaging-App (In Progress)

A simple Messaging App that I developed to practice my knowledge on:
- Java FX
- Database Connectivity
- Encryption

To Use:
- Register by creating a unique useername with a password
- Go back to the login page and connect with your username and password
- As soon as the App opens, you can add users by typing their username in the top right search bar
- When a user (contact) is added, you can access your chat by tapping on the contact's name in the sidebar on the right side of the app
- Enjoy!
